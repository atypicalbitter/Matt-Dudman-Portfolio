## Introduction

As a dedicated front-end web development student, I've created this portfolio to present my skills and projects to potential employers. The portfolio incorporates core skills such as flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. The goal is to not only showcase my work but also to provide insights into the thought processes behind each project.

## About

### The sections in my portolio include

* About Me: Learn more about me, my background, and skills.

* Work: Explore a collection of my projects that I have made so far and some social links with more projects soon to come!

* Contact: Find out how to get in touch with me by Email, Linkedin or Github. 

Clicking on any of these links will smoothly scroll the UI to the corresponding section, providing a seamless user experience.

Recognising the importance of adaptability, this portfolio is designed to be responsive. Whether you're viewing it on a large desktop screen or a smaller mobile device, the layout adapts to your viewport. Media queries ensure a smooth and visually pleasing experience across various screens and devices.

Below are the 2 wireframes that I designed before going starting the task.
